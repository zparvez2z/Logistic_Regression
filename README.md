# My_Logistic_Regression_practice
this is my repository of Logistic Regression practice 
Here I worked on the Titanic Data Set from Kaggle. This is a very famous data set and very beginner friendly .

Here I tried to predict a classification- survival or deceased. I used a "semi-cleaned" version of the titanic data set, if you use the data set hosted directly on Kaggle, you may need to do some additional cleaning not shown in this notebook.

Logistic Regression :
  Logistic regression is a classification model that is very easy to implement but performs very well on linearly separable classes. It is one of the most widely used algorithms for classification in industry.
  
  It is also called the logistic function, sometimes simply abbreviated as sigmoid function due to its characteristic S-shape.
