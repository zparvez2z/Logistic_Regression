Here I worked on the Titanic Data Set from Kaggle. This is a very famous data set and very beginner friendly .

Here I tried to predict a classification- survival or deceased. I used a "semi-cleaned" version of the titanic data set, if you use the data set hosted directly on Kaggle, you may need to do some additional cleaning not shown in this notebook.
